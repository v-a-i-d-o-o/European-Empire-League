Section I - League Overview
League Structure
The European Empire League is a 12 team, single division, Dynasty League with an Empire pot. Teams will compete each season in a head to head, PPR scoring format in an attempt to finish with one of 6 playoff places, and will then do battle in a post season knockout playoff to be crowned Champions of the season.

Commissioner Site Powers and Duty
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams if necessary. The commissioner has a duty to uphold the integrity, competitive spirit, and enjoyment of the league, and will only ever use his abilites/powers to fulfill this duty. If any team/owner threatens any of these fundamental aspects of the league, they can be removed or replaced.

Dispute Arbitration
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tiebreaking vote. When an issue arrises where a clear conflict of interest is apparant, the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).

Rule Changes
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called by the commissioner and receive a majority from league members. The commissioner votes just like other members, and in a tie the commissioners vote will be the tie breaker. A vote will be considered quorate if at least 10 league members cast a vote. League members may submit potential rule/structure changes at any time to the commissioner for consideration. Rule changes will always be voted on in the off season, prior to the rookie draft.

Collusion
Collusion (two or more owners conspiring to provide an unfair advantage to one or more teams) will not be tolerated, in any form. Examples of collusion include but are not limited to: throwing games, renting players (when a player is traded to another team with the understanding the player will be returned to the original team at a later date), dumping players (in an attempt to give another team a waiver advantage by giving them inside knowledge of player availability) or making unfair trades. Owners found guilty of collusion will be immediately removed from the league without refund.

Tanking/Throwing Games
Intentional “tanking” or attempting to lose games for any reason is strictly prohibited. The rookie draft order is decided in such a way (see section viii - rookie draft) that tanking by setting sub optimal lineups is not beneficial, but to maintain the integrity and ensure the competitive fairness of the league, all teams must set their lineups properly, and in the “spirit of the game” every gameweek. This means that teams must have full starting rosters, and managers must not, in an attempt to influence results, select players who are either: a) obviously unlikely to play for any reason, or b) obviously unlikely to contribute significantly compared to players they leave on the bench. Sit/Start decisions are affected by many factors, and except for in extreme and obvious examples, will always be a matter for individual managers, but the commissioner reserves the right to make changes to a teams lineup in scenarios where they are obviously in breach of this rule.

Team Owner Responsibilities
In a dynasty league, it is essential that all owners are active in some fashion all year round. Owners should respond to all trade offers in a timely manner, even if it is just to politely decline. Lineups should always be set, and owners should endeavour to respond to league communications as soon as possible. Fantasy football is a game built around manager interaction, and banter/rivalry/trash talking is actively encouraged. It should however go without saying that hateful abuse of any kind will not be tolerated, bigots of any kind are not welcome in the ESL and will be removed.

Team Owner Leaving
If a team’s owner no longer wishes to continue to participate in the ESL, please contact the League Commissioner as soon as possible in order that they may arrange a replacement owner. If possible, this should be done at the conclusion of a season, before any off season activities commence, and well in advance of the rookie draft. Any owner leaving for any reason during a season will forfeit that seasons league fees, and any future league fees paid. In the event of an owner leaving the league mid-season for any reason, the Commissioner will run the former owners team by inserting the players at each position with the highest projected total until the ownership is filled. No trades/waiver pick ups will be made.

Owner Removal
If an owner is not adhering to proper ownership guidelines (setting rosters, not responding to league communications, behaving in an aggressive or intimidating manner etc.) then they are subject to possible removal by the commissioner. Any owner removed for such an offense will forfeit any league fees paid.




Section III - League Dues
Entry Fee
The Entry Fee for the league is $50 per team. This covers the 2022 season which starts on 09/09/22. In addition all managers must pay the dues for the second season (2023) at the same time as paying the entry fee. These fees must be paid 48 hours before the start up draft commences.
All entry fees will be handled by the Teamstake website. All credit/debit card transactions will be subject to a 4% fee, so owners will be charged this on top of their entry fees.
Yearly Dues
After the first two years there is a yearly total of $50 that must be paid 2 weeks before the start of the yearly rookie draft.
Dues must also be paid immediately for any year a team trades draft picks in. These fees will be due within 24 hours of the trade being completed. Failure to pay these dues will result in the trade being cancelled.
Penalties
If a team does not pay their dues by the designated date they are not eligible to participate in the draft (startup or rookie) it will be up to the commissioners discretion on whether or not to replace them.




Section IV - Payout
12 x $50 entry fee = $600 prize pool

Top 3 finishers after the playoffs receive prizes.

1st Place: $250
2nd Place: $125
3rd Place: $50



Highest scoring team each week of regular season: $5 (total: $70) This will be paid at the end of the playoffs with other league prizes.
The owner of the fantasy player that scores the highest points in a single during the regular season will also receive $5.

Immediately following the Championship game, rosters will expand to give teams 30 bench spots to accomodate incoming rookies/free agents for the following season.
Following the 3rd preseason NFL game, bench spots will be returned to the standard size of 20, so managers must make the required cuts to allow for this. The exact date/time of the cut deadline will be posted in league chat.
Players will only be eligible for IR spots if they are designated as IR, Covid or Suspended.



Section VI - Free Agency & Trading
Free Agency
Free agency/waivers will be based on the FAAB system.
Each team will receive $300 for a Free Agency Aquisition Budget at the start of week 1 of the NFL season.
Minimum bid to get a FA off waivers is $0
FAAB dollars are not tradeable, nor will they roll over to next season.
Waivers will process on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Free agency/waivers will close following the completion of the playoffs and will not reopen until the conclusion of our rookie draft.
When free agency/waivers recommence following the rookie draft, each team will receive an off season budget of $300 that will be topped back up to $300 at the start of week 1 of the NFL season. Off season waivers will process on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Trades
All trades will be processed on acceptance by all parties without a review period. All trades will be allowed unless obvious collusion takes place. If anyone has any concerns regarding collusion in trades, these should be raised with the commissioner. If the commissioner has serious suspicions about a trade, the validity of such a trade can be put to a league vote. Trades can be reversed by the commissioner if required as a result.
Trade deadline is at the end of week 13 (check Sleeper for details).
During the offseason trading is still allowed. Trading can re-commence after the completion of the Championship game.
Draft picks up to 2 seasons in the future are tradable.
Teams must pay dues for any year they trade draft picks in.



Section VII - Startup Draft
Will commence June 10th 2021 on Sleeper, or earlier if all fees are paid.
Draft order will be randomized using 100yardrush.com and live streamed on youtube.
Startup draft will be a combined rookie/vets draft.
Snake format (1st to 12th then 12th to 1st).
Each day the draft will last from 7AM to 11PM BST with each team having 8 hours per pick. The draft will be paused outside of these hours. Managers should endeavour to make their picks as soon as possible.
Trading draft picks is allowed during the startup draft.
If a team misses their pick the best available player based on Sleeper ADP will be autopicked.



Section VIII - Rookie Draft
Rookie Draft Order
The draft order for subsequent rookie drafts will be determined based on the following:
Picks 1-6 will be based on the maximum potential points scored by the 6 teams not advancing to the playoffs (see Playoffs/Championship Bracket below) according to sleeper MAX PF in reverse order. So from the 6 teams not advancing to the playoffs, the team with the lowest potential points scored in the regular season will receive pick 1.01, the team with the second lowest potential points the 1.02 and so on. This system tries to ensure the teams who need the most help from the rookie draft get it, without encouraging tanking. (To view maximum potential points, in Sleeper go to: Standings>View details and see MAX PF.)
Picks 7-12 will be assigned based on playoff finishing position/seeding of the 6 teams who advance to the playoffs. For example, Champion -1.12, Runner up -1.11, Third -1.10, Fourth -1.09. Picks 1.08/1.07 will be based on the playoff seeding of the two remaining teams, the highest seeded team will have pick 1.08, the lowest 1.07.
Rookie Draft Settings
There will be 4 rounds of the rookie draft.
The rookie draft will take place shortly after completion of the NFL draft.
The draft will follow a linear format just like the NFL draft (1.01 has 2.01, 3.01, 4.01 etc.)
Each day the draft will last from 8AM to 11PM BST with each team having 8 hours per pick.
Trading draft picks is allowed during the rookie draft
If a team misses their pick the best available player based on Sleeper ADP will be autodrafted.
Any undrafted rookie will be treated as a Free Agent according to Sleepers database.



Section IX - Schedule & Playoffs
Regular Season Schedule
The regular season lasts from week 1 to week 14.
Matches will be randomly determined at the beginning of the season.
Playoffs begin week 15 with the championship game occuring week 17.



Playoffs
Championship Bracket
The two teams with the best regular season records (1/2 in the standings) will be assigned to the top two seeds, and will recieve a bye in the first week of playoffs.
The next three teams (3/4/5) will be assigned their playoff seeding spot based on regular season record.
The final playoff spot will be awarded to the team with the highest points scored out of the remaining 7 teams regardless of league standing, this team will be the final seed in the playoffs.
Consolation Bracket (Toilet Bowl)
Seeding will be determined by end of regular season standing for the 6 teams not in the Championship Bracket.
These teams will compete to try not to finish last in the league and be crowned Toilet Bowl Champions. Teams finishing in 11th and 12th place receive a bye in the first week of Toilet Bowl playoffs. Winning teams in each round will escape the Toilet Bowl, while losing teams will be flushed to the next round.
The consolation bracket has no bearing on draft order, theres only pride at stake here.
